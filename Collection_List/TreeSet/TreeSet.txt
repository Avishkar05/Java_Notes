TreeSet:

	->  TreeSet is a predefined class which implements Navigable Set directly and indirectly to the Sorted Set.
	-> We use object of TreeSet class.
	-> TreeSet is one of the most important implementation of the Sorted Set interface in Java that uses a tree for storage, 
		i.e. Balance Tree or Binary Tree or Self Balance Tree or Red Black Tree.
	-> The ordering of the element is maintained by using their natural ordering (Sorting Order).
	-> The objects of the TreeSet are stored in ascending order.

Imp Points:
	i) TreeSet is a homogeneous concept
	ii) It doesn't allow the insertion order
	iii) TreeSet prefers sorting order
	iv) The internal data structure of TreeSet is Balance Tree
	v) It is a non-synchronized concept
	vi) Duplicates are not allowed because it follows the sorting order
	vii) NULL is not allowed
