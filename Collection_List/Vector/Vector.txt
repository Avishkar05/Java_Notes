Vector :
	-> Vector is a legacy Class
	-> Vector is a implement class of list interface present in Java.util Package
	-> Vector is a growable and resizable array
	-> all legacy Class methods are synchronized method
	
Properties of Vector :
	-> Index based data Structure.
	-> we can store homogenous as well as heterogenous type of data
	-> Store duplicate element
	-> Store multiple NULL values
	-> Follow insertion order
	-> doesn't follow sorting order
	-> Methods are synchronized
	-> Thread Safe
	-> Performance slow
